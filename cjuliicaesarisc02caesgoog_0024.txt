him, end had a large army at their command. Leaving M. Antony
and Lepidus behindto manage the affairs of ltaly,and sending others
olbis friends to talre possession of Sicily, Sardinia, and Africa, he
hastened to Spain. Some of these generals were nnsuccessfule hut
their losses were more than counterhalanoed by the advantages which
Caesar himself gained. On hie way, he found that tho town of Mas·
silio refused ιο submit to him ς but, without allowing himself to he ‘
detained, he left two oi his legates ιο lay siege to the plaee, and pro·
ceeded to Spain. He there met with great difficulties, and sustained
some severe reverses3 botin the end he compellod Afranius and
Petreius ιο surrender: they were dismissed unhurt, and their troops
joined those of the conqueror. The subjugation of Spain was curn·
pleted within forty days. On his return to Gaul, Massilia was still
holding out, hut he soon compelled a surrender, arrd treated the in·
habitante with leniency and forbearance.

Before quitting Massilia, Caesar was informed that, on the proposui
of M. Lepidus, he had been appointed dictator. This had of course
been done at Caesar’s own suggestion, and he now hestened to Rome
ιο preside at the consular electione. Being elected one of the consuls
for a. c. 48, ho laid down his dictatorship, after having been invested
with it only eleven days. During his stay at Rome,which was very
short, he acted as if he had been the aelrnowledged sovereign of the
state, and hed several beneficial laws passed, which greatly increased
his populerity. In December, n. e. 49, he set out for Brundusium,
where his troops were already assembled. Pompey in the meantime
had not been idle in Greece3 he had collected a large army, arrd great
sums of money, and his lieet swayed the Mediterraneum Caesar’s
lieet, on the other hand, was so small, that he could not 'at onoe
