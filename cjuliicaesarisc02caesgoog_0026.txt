nupsit 01 Caesada character: he showed a clemency and readiness

to forgive which filled his enemies with amarement3 and did every·
thing in his power to alley all animosity and party spirit. The die-
tatorship was now bestowed upon him for ten years, and the censor?
ship, under the new title of praefectura morum, for three. In his
triumphs which he celebrated 0101 his sanquished enemies, he took
care not to hurt the feelings of the Romans by mentionirrg Roman
011100000011011 objecta. When these· solemnities, and their accom-
panying festivities, were orer, hs proceeded to make several very
salutary legal enactments. The most importent among bis measures
was the reform 01110 calendar, which, through the arhitrary manage·
ment of the pontiffs, had been thrown into such confusion, that at
that time it was about three mouths in adrancs 01 110 natural 11010.
, ’1110 1010101· was accomplished in a. 0. 46, with the assistance of the>
Alexandrian mathem'atician Sosigenes.

In the meantime the two sons of Pompey, Gneius and Ssrtus,hed
collected the 1001 remnants of their father’s party in Spain, and being
joined by many 01 110 Spaniards, they resolved to make a last and
desperate attempt to 1000101 what was lost. As 0000 00 Caesar
heard 01 11011 monomenta, he hastened to Spain towards the end of
1.0. 46. 'f'he enemies offered 0 10001 desperate resistance; but 110
battle of Munda,which Caesar was 00 the point of lesing, and which
he gained only by hie personat 101001 and intrepidity, decided the
fate of his antagonistas. Cneius was killed, but Sextus made 111000-
cape. 001110 return to Rome in October 100. 46, Caesar celebrated
another triumph, and was received by the senate with the most abjeci
flattery and servility: he was honoured with the title 01 ‘Father 01
110 Country ς’ statues 01 him were erected in 011 110 temples, the
mouth of Quintilis, 10 which 110 was horn, was henceforth called
Julius (Jnly); he received the title of Imperator, and 110 dictator·
ship for life, aud the consulship 101110 next ten years. These and
other extraordinary distinctions were literally showered upon him:
he, in 1001, was the sorereign 01 110 empire. He now began to de·
vise vast schemes 101 110 benetit 01 110 country and his fellow citi·
aens. He increased the number 01 110 senators, quaestore, aediles,
and praetore, which affnrded him the means 01 rewarding 111000 friends
who had sarred him 10 110 1010 strugglcs. He also undertoolr 01 de·
sigued a great number 01 works of public utility; but few 01 them
were completed, 00 his career was cut short in the midst 01 110 plane.
It is a singular fact, 1101 among his numerous schemas there is none to
show that he intended to reform 110 constitution of the republic; but
it seems hewae convinced that no reform could restore that of which
the soul and spirit had departed long since, andarchii 110 aimed 01

reform, he must hare known that the 11101 thing 10110 10001100 to
