than to place all that is dear to man in perpetual jeopardy.
As a general, Caesar had from the first displayed all the quali·
ties ol a grem military genius; and though, in the province of Gaul,
he sacrificed the lives of thousands of barbatiane without remorso, yet
throughout his civil wara he ahowed a generosity aud mildness
¹ towards hia sanquished opponente which filled those who had seen
the fearful days of Marius and Sulla with admiration and affection.
For the display ofhis statesmanship he had little time; but what he
did, is enough to show what he would have accomplished, if hs had
been permitted to carry out his plana.

Perhaps tho most surprising circumstance in Caesar's cassania the
fact that, notwithstanding his extraordinary activity ever alter his
entering upon public life, he found leisure to cultivate the arte and
literature, and to composa works which, like those of Cicero, gare
the literary tone and character to that period, and which to this day
are ranked among the finest specimens of ancient literature. Unfor·
tuuataly, the greater number of them are lost, and only a few isolated
passages romain, which are occasionally quoted by later writers. Hs
was also one of the first oratore of his age, and we possess a long
catalogue of subjecta on which be epoho in public. But it was not
only the history and politica of his own time which engaged hie at·
tention: there was nothing capable of furnishing materiale for the
human mind to redcct upon, which did not at one time or another
occupy him; and among bis napny worlas, there was one even on
grammar, which is often quoted as an authority by tho later gram·
mariana of Rome. ln short, Caesar must be pronounced to have
been a universal genius: he was great not only as a general, but as
a statesman, a lawgiver‚ a jurist‚ an orator, a poet, an historiari, a
scholar, a mathematician, andan architect.

The existing productioris of Caesar are hia rnemoirs of the Gallio
and civil ware, under the title of Commentarii-that is, diarias or
Journms. Their style is distinguished for its noble simplicby, trans·
parent clearness and precision, as well as perfect freedom from all
rhetorical pomp. They arc, in fact, specimens of what the language
of conversation among men ofoducation and talent was in those times;

¹ and the few peculiarities and irregularities which their style presente
are, on the whole, nothing but what may be termed conversational ¹
licences, showing a total absence ol everything studies] and formal.
The substance of these worlrs was probably written down during the
campaigns themselves, and they were afterwards revised in the time
which their author spent in winter quarters. The commentarii of
the Gallio war contain tho history of the first seren years omissam-
