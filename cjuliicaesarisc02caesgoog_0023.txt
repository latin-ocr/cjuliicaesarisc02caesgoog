tation by a refusal, despatched the legions, though he knew that, in
all probability, they were intended to serre against himself. Some
time aster this, he took up his winter quarters at Ravenna, the
southernmost town ol Cisalpine Gaul, and close upon the confines
ef Italy. Haring there learned lrom Curio the real state of affairs,
he sent him with a conciliatory letter to the senate. When Curio
arrived at Rome, the senata could hardly be preaailed upon ιο allow
the letter to be read ς and alter some violent discussion, it was agreed
that, unless Caesar should disband his army before a certain day, he
should be treated as a public enemy. Two tribunes interposed their
veto, but to no purpose3 and as even their lives ware threatened,
they tled in disgnise to Caesar at Ravenna, calling upon him to pro·
teet the sacred character ol the tribuneship. The senate, entirely
relying upon Pompey, who never dreamt os the possibility os Caesar
talring up arms against him, and who tancied that it required only
. bis word to ronse all ltaly ιο arms, commanded the consuls to pro-
vide l'or the safety ol the republic. War was now declared, and the
whole management ol it intrnsted to Pompey. But the aristocracy
hed misealculated: Pompey, in his sslf-sufficieney, had neglected
. every precaution, and his party was so unpopular, that it was scarcely
possible to induce any man to enrol his name aa a soldier.

When Caesar was intormed by the tribunes of the last decree os
tha senate, hs assembled the lew troops hehad with him, (lor his
main army was still beyond the Alps) and set out towards the small
river Rubicon, which formed the boundary between his province of
Cisalpine Gaul and Italy. On its beaks he balred for a while, doubt-
ful as to whether he should venture upon the unconstitutional act
ol advancing3 but at length he called out, ‘⁴ The die is cast !’' and
crossed the river. 'ras considerationes his own safety compelled him
to act es hadid: there was no alternative. As he marched south·
ward, all the towns threw their gates open to him, and bis progress
was like an uninterrupted triumph. The tear and alann at Rome
beeame so great, that the senate, with Pompey at their head, tled trem
the city to Capua, and thence ιο Brundusium, sorgetting in their
hurty even to take with them the contente ol the public treasury.
caesar met with no resistanca till he came to Corfinium but aa
Pompcy did not come to the relies os the town, it surrendered; and
the clemency and generosity with which the conqueror here, as else·
where, treated his humbled opponents‚ at once won the attachment
and admiration os all. Pompey, who was resolved to quit Italy,
reached Brundusium before Caesar, and on the rtth ol March he
ambarked sor Greeee. As Caesar had no flaet, he was unable ιο
persae himg and he accordingly returned, and determined first to
