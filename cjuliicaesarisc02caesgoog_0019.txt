rowed money ε, his populerity became immense, and was increassd
by the manner in which be contrived on every occasion to humble
the pride of the aristocracy. One morning, the trophies and statues
of Marius, which had been removed from the Capitol by Sulla, were
found restored to their places. Every one knew thet this was Caesar's
doing, and the people were delighted at the reappearance of the
monuments of their great champion, while the senatorial party,
though alarmed in the highest degree, and apprehending nothing
short of a revolution, did not dare to challenge his conduct. After
bis aedilesbip be continued to ennoy the partisans of the senate iu
various ways, but chiefly by bringing accusatione against those who
were guilty of crimes committed under the protection of the laws of
Sulla. This, however, he did, not so much with, tbe intention of
’ bringing those persone to punishment, as of preventing tbe senatorial
party from any further summary or unconstitutional proceedings
against tbe popular party. In n-c. 63 he was elected chief pontiti,
although men far above him in raulr and station were bis competi·

following.

His enemies now made every effert to checlr him in his rapid pro·

privately and publicly charged with being an accomplice; but ncta

that mad end senseless scheme. During his praetorship vehement
disputes were agitated, on account of Cicero having put to death
some of the associetes of Cataline without a formal trial. Caesar
supported the euenisset Cicero, while M. Cato opposed bim. Owing
to tha violence with which the question was debated, Caesar and one
>of the tribunes were suspended by tbe senate from their offices3 but
-Gaesar’s conduct on thet occasion was so well calculated, and ao pru-¹
dent, that tbe senate in the end was obliged to apologire for its hasty
measure, and publicly to thanlr him for bis moderatiori. This was
e great bumiliation for the aristocratic party, but they had* brought
it upon themselves. In the·same year Caesar divorcsd his wife
Pompeia, having discovered that she was carrying on an intrigus
with the notorious P. Clodius3 but he did not prosecute the offender,
becarm he was very popular, and a man of great ‚importunos to
Gaesar’s own party.

Alter the termination of his praetorship, Caesar undertoolr the
administrationes the province of Western Spain. His debts had
at this time become so enormous, and bis creditore so clamemus,
that be was obliged to talre some steps towards relieving himself
