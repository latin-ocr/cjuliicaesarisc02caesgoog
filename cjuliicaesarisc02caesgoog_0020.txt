before quitting Roma. 'l'he wealthy Crassus and other friends be·
came sacurhy for him ς and matters being thus arranged, he set out
for his province. He was now, for the first time, at the head of au
army, and in a short time, like a trus military genius, he at once
displayed all the qualities of a great general. After having sub·
dued some of the mountain tribes of Lusitania, and taken Brigan-
tium, a town of tho Gallaeoi, he returned to Rome. The money
he had collected in Spain enabled him to pay his debts, end in n. c.
60 he offered himself as a candidate for the consulship. His own
intluence and popularity, aad tha support of Pompey, securad his
election3 but the aristocrats, by immense exertion and bribery, con-
trivsd to obtain the appointment of Μ. Bibulus, a stout ¹champion of
their party, as his oolleague. Pompey had before this time delini·
tively joined the popular party; for, on his return from tho Mithri-
datic war, the senato refused to ratify the regulations which he had
mado in Asia, and Caesar promised him by and by to compel its
sanction. Alter his electicn, Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus formed
an alliauce, in which thoy agreed to support one another3 their union
rendered them invincible, and they accordingly had the fate of the
republic in their hands. The year of Caesar’s consulship isremarlr·

the senate to publish the reports of its proceedings, whereby it became
amenahle to public opinion. The second was an agrarian law, by
which twenty thousand citizens, and among them many of Pompey’s
veterana, received assignmentsof the public land in Campania. This
law was carried by force of arms, and in spite of the most violent
oppositiones the aristocracy and his collaague Bibulus, who was so
mortified by the enactmant, that he withdraw altogether from publio
life until the expiration ofhis consulship„ By this law Caesar gained
the firmest hold on tho attachment of the peopla; and his next mea-
sure was calculated to secure the favour of the equites. These men,
in their eagerness to obtain contracts for raising the publio ravenue
in the provinces, had offered largar sums than they could afford, and
Caesar now prevailed upon the people to relieve thern of one-third
of their payrnent. After this he induced the senate to sanction the
regulations of Pompey in Asia. The senate had assigned to Caesar
a province from which neither fame nor gain could hs derived3 hut
as hs hed now secured the support of the people, the equites, and
Pompey, he prerailed upon the tribune Vatinius to propose to the
people that, after the expiration of his consulship, he should rsoaive
the administrationes Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years.

'Phe bill was passed; and the senate, of its own accord, added the pro-
vince of Transalpino Gaul,lt beingapprehended that tha people would
demand it for Caesar. Ia order to attach Pompey ashrrmy aeus*
