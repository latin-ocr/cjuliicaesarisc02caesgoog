PREFAGE.

'l'aa Publishere' Notice sufficiently explains the nature and
design 01 the series of which the present volume-C. Junrr
0100101000111111001011 00 Beato Garnae-forme a part. In
reference to the text, l have 10 the first four books adopted
tbat 010. E. C. Schneider (Helle, 1840,810.), 0110ιο excellent
edition is unfortunately not completed; while in tha remaining
· three l have chiefly followed the edition of 0. G. Herzog (Leipzig, a
1831, 800). I have, however, considered it necessary to aban·
don certain peculiarities of orthography adopted by the former
01 these authorities, for, although more correct than the common
orthography, they would be perplexing to pupils who bave only
the ordinary dictionaries at their command.

With respectto the notes which are to aceompnny the different
texta, 00 additional word ,01 explanation seems desirable. ln the
writinga 01 every ancient author, a number of passages occur
presenting grammatical difficulties, or relating to 111010110οΙ, geo-
010011ῑο01, and other particulare, which a youth cannot under-
stand without conaulting 0 variety 01 boolrs3 and in the greater
number 01 100100000, these books 010 either not at hi· command,
or il be does possess them, he 10 often ignorant 01 the manner
01 gathering from them the required information. The object,
therefore, 01 the 00100, and other illustratione, ie to remove auch
difficulties, and generally to afford an aid to those who 010 die-
posed to make 0 reasonable exertion 10 mastering the subject 01
their 1000000. Nothing, however, can bc more destructive 10 the
mental energiee of pupils, ‘than placing before thern annotatione
00 0 principle of indiscriminate 11000101100;101,1001001101 00110-
ing them 1001011 their minda, and acquire habits of exact reason-
ing and investigation-an important object in classical training
-the assistance 00 unduly afforded robs them 01 011 motiva 101
01011100, and deprives them 01 the invaluable pleaeure 01 cou-
quering difficulties, and of feeling thet they have been instru-
mental in their own instruction.
