Asis Minor ln submission to Roma. Before tha sud of the year
ha returned home, having been elected ponriff' rn the place of his
uncle, C. Aurelius Cotta. Upon his arrival, ha used every means

to' mcreasa his popularity3 and aa his property was not large,
he borrowed money from the usurers, who willingly gave him
what ha demanded, though they had no security. except his
honesty‚ and the prospect that ,some public office might affort]
him the means of paying his debts. Not long after, he was elected
by ths peopla one of the tribunes of the soldiers, though weda

carried on against Mithridates, Sertorius, and Spartacus. Itis
