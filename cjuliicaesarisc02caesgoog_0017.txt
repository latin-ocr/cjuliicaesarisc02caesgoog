before appointed3 also cf the dowry cf his wife, andos his own prc-
perty3 and if he had remained at Rome, his life would undoubtedly
have been sacrificed. He therefore withdrew into the country, until
he was pardoned through the mediation of the vestal virgins and some
of his frienda3 though Sulla forgave him with reluctance, remarking
that this young man would be the ruin of the aristocracy, for that
many Mariuses were elumbering iu him.

instead· of remaining at'home, Caesar preferred seraing in the
army, which was then engaged in Asia Minor; and he there so much
distinguished himself, that he was rewarded witha civic crown. In
rt. c. 78 he was serving under P. Servilius against the Isaurians end
pirates, when the news of Sulla’s death induced him to retunt to
Rome. He was too prudent, and had too little confidence in Lepi·
dus, to join him in his attempt to abolish the institutions of the late
dictator; and like most young Romans of the time, he began his
public career as an orator in the courts of justice. He accused seve·
ral of the partisans of Sulla who had been guilty cf extorticn and
oppression in the provinces: but his first efforts were unsuccessful, ‘
not from his want of power as an orator, but because it was a matter

the servants of Caesar, who were sent out, succeeded ‘in thirty-eight
days’ in obtaining the sum of fifty talenta, with which he ransomed
himself. While in the hands of the pirates, Caesar gave proofs of
κ his extraordinary mind, and of the power which he exercised over
all with whom he came in contact. sc far from conducting himself
as their captive, he treated thern as if he had been their master,
without their venturing to punish him; and no sooner had he re·
gained his liberty, thau he manned some ships'in tha port of Miletus,
attached the pirates, toolr several of thern prisoners, and crucified
them, although he was not invested with any official power or
authority

His stay in Rhodes did not extend beyond one year; ond iu
aaut, when Mithridates, king of Pontus, resumed hostilitia·
against the Romans, Caesar, though still a private person, col·
