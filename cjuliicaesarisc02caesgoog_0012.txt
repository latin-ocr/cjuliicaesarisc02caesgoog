Tua study ol Greek aud Roman literature is usually considered
an indispensable branch os a liberal educatiou. By offering to
the young the contemplation os great minds, as reflected in the
worlrs ot' the classic authors ol antiquity, it extends the range of
ideas, aud becomes aspecies ot' intellectuat training, which, though
differing from, is not inferior to, that imparted by the study of
the exact sciences. Resides these advantages, au acquaintance
with the languages os ancient Greece and Rome is desirable, on
account of the extent to which they enter into the formation cf
our own and other Europeau tongues, as well as into the con·
structiou of all scientific nomenclatura. .

Latteriy, a disposition hasbeen manifested to undervalue clas
sical auctomento, but this may be salely ascribed less to the de·
manda made by other branchos of learning, thau to the manner in
which Greek and Latin have usually been imparted. Evarythiug
may be carried to axcess3 and it cannot be doubted that the prac-
tice os teaching these languages as mere verhal acquirements to the
exclusion os things more directly available in active life, has done
incalculable damage to the principles of a liberal educatiou. To
restore the Classica to their proper place, all that seems necessary
is, to malie them a part, not the whole, of school instruction3 thus
allowing time and opportunity for acquiring the elemento os those
arts and sciences without which any system ol modern tuition
would be faulty and incompleta. To aid this desirable object, it
appears to us that nothing is more wanted thau au improved
series oi school-books, hy which the study may be facilitated, aud
rendered attractive, instead of au object of avernen, as here·
tosore, to learners. An affort must bc made to help pupils over
difficulties which unduly rctard their progress, and unnecessarily
consume their time. Such an effert is the intended Ouassroar.
