establish his own power on asaro and legal foundation. lt was
perhaps for this reason that he was not content with the substance
of regal power, but was anxious also to have theoutward signs of
royalty, and thereby, as it were, to legalise that which ha possessed.
An attempt was accordingly made by Μ. Antony to offer him the
diadem in February rac. 443 butas the peopls received the pro·
posal with coolness, Caesar for the present declined the honour.
How much he was bent upon obtaining it, however, became manifest
soon after, when two of the tribunes were seut into exile for having
ventured to manifest their disapproval of conferring upon hira the
kingly title.
- One of bis great plaus was to secure the eastern frontier of the
empire by a war against the Parthians, for which some preparatione Α
had already besu made. When the Sibyllino books were consulted
. respecting the undertaking, they were reported to state that the Par-
thians could bo conquered only by a king3 and ona of Caesar's
friends accordingly was to bring forward a proposui in thamnata,
that Caesar out of Italy should be permitted to assume the tit-le of
king. But this scheme was frustrated; fora conspiracy had been
formed against the life of the dictator at the very beginning of the
year. It was headed by Cassius and Brutus, and upwards of sinty
persons ware privy to it. Their pretext was the restoration of the
republi03 but with the exception of Brutus, there was perhaps not
one who was actuarad'by pure motives3 many of them had bean
mercifully treated, aud promoted to high honours, by him whom they
now conspired to murder, and others, such as Cassius, had no other
motiva except wounded pride and thwarted ambition. The lbth of
’ March, the day on which Caesar was to receive the title of king,
was fixad upon by the conspirators as a fit opportunity for carrying
their design into effect When Caesar, having been cautioned in
vain, entered the senate-boues, one of the conspirators approacbcd
him, asif ho were about to aslr some favour, and then gave him the
furstblow. Caesar defended himself manfully until he perceived
Brutus, whom he lored lihe a son, among the conspirators3 he then
serapt himself up in his toga, and sank efter receiving twenty-three
vounds. He died in the fifty-sixth year of his ege, n. c. 44.
Thus did Rome lose- the only man who could have restored
peace end happiness to tho state and under whose mild sway
' ahs might have forgotten the woea she had been suffering
for the last fifty years. Those who pretended to restore free-
dom, only plunged the eommonwealth into still greater miserias
than those from which she had emerged through the victorico
uf Caesar, until, ultimately, it was found preferable to enjoy
moe aad tlrs security of life end property, under ons roslar?
