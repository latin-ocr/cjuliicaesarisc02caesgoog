Pompey, their friendship began to coel, especially on the part of the
latter. The death of Crassus in his unfortunate campaign against the
Parthians, in a. c. 53, left Caesar and Pompey alone at the head of

the republic. Gaesar’s victories ln Gaul daily increased his reputa·

tion, and roused the people's admiration of his exploits3 while Pom·
pey, who had once been the greatest man of the state, began to per.
eeive, with feelings of mortification, that Caesar was rising above him
ln publio estimation. Hence Pompey took no steps to check the

terrible anarchy which prevailed at Roma about the end of a. c. 53,
and the beginning of n. c. 52, in consequence of the morderes Cla-

dius. During these disturbances he hoped to be called to the dicta·

torship3 hut though he was disappointed in this, his vanity was
gratified by being elected sole consul. As this was the doing of the
aristocracy, he was inclined to become reconciled to them. He now
also procured for himself the prolongation of his proconsulship of

Spain for five years; but as he did not yet think it advisable to break
with cassanha had at the same time alaw passed, conferring ou
Caesar the privilege of standing for the consulship without appearing
at Rome in person. In the meantime, however, 'Pompey continued
to attach himself more closely to the aristocracy, who, in consequence,
became bolder and holder in the display ol their hatred towards Cae·
sar. ln a. e. 51, the consul M. Claudius Marcellus, one of the most
violent aristocrats‚ proposed to send a successor of Caesar to Gaul,
because the pacification af that province was completed; and at the

ι sometime he made an attempt to deprive Caesar of the privilege
which Pompey’s intluence had rccently procured for him. The con·
suls of the year following, and the energetic tribune 0. Curio, were
expected to strike a decisive blow at our hero, as they were believed
to be warm supporters of Pompey and the senate; but Caesar’s
agents, and the liberal bribes which he caused to be distributed among
the leading men, thwarted the plane of the aristocracy, and Curio was
completely bought over. As the senate dreaded nothing samuch as

· the election of Caesar to the consulship ln his absence, and whilehe
was at the head of his army, it was decreed‚ on the proposal of O.
Marcellus, that he should lay down his command before the l3th of
November, a. e. 50-an unreasonable demand, as his proconsulship
had legally to last for another year. Curio, however, interposed his
veto, and the decree was annulled.

- Caesar, fully convinced that he could not appear in Rome as a
private person· without exposing his life to imminent danger, in the
mean time had marched to Cisalpine Gaul, and was received by ali
the towns with the greatest enthusiasm. The senate before this hau

demanded that he should give up two ol his legions,alleging thattheg
